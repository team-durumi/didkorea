DID X-Ring chain is the best value of maintenance-free chain available.","2. The patented X-Ring design has half the friction of normal O-Ring chain and provides great sealing performance. It keeps the dirt out and the grease in much better than any other O-rings.","3. Up to 2 times longer wear resistance performance compared to normal O-Ring chains.","4. Great cost savings can be achieved through longer life and less down time.","5.
